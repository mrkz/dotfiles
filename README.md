# dotfiles
dotfiles with preferred settings

This files are supposed to be managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

## usage
simply run the `setup.sh` script.
**note**: You may want to review the script and the dotfiles before
executing the script as they may touch sensible files
(~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, ~/.ssh among others).

```
$ ./setup.sh
```

## Licence
The script and dotfiles of my own are licensed under the MIT license. However,
other repositories and scripts included (e.g: vim plugins, etc) may have their
own licences. Please check them carefully.
